# no-sql_challenge-
Module 12

The NoSQL Challenger incorporates the use of MongoDB to arrange and analyse data referring to food establishments in the United Kingdom. From creating a Mongo client, a server allows for a database to be stored and imported to VSCode for notebook setup. 

The setup of the data requires info to be imported as a json file from the MongoDB terminal. The data can then be investigated and counted using the various functions provided by the pymongo client including counting the unique values from data, counting and aggregating. The setup also requires an additional restaurant to be added to the data through the update_one function.  

The analysis of the data uses the same principles to importing data but uses the additional query function to create pipelines for which data can be transformed and investigated. Queries allow specific characteristics of each establishment to be highlighted, restricting the display of establishments based on the selected requirements.
